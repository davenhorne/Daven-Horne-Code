# Daven-Horne-Code
My name is Daven Horne, I'm from Florida. Got my Bachelor's Degree in Sociology and a minor in Criminology from USF.
Prior to joining Revature I spent some time learning HTML/CSS on my own because I was thinking about getting into web design as a way to break into the tech space.
I happened upon the Revature and decided to apply as it was an opportunity to learn more.
Revup program learning Java. I trained in Salesforce. I am an avid gamer and love to watch anime.
